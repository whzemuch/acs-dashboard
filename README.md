# ACS Dashboard

Data files (recommended)

Boundaries (static): counties.geojson (GEOID, NAME, geometry) ‚Äî simplified for web (e.g., with mapshaper).

Centroids (static): county_centroids.csv (GEOID, lon, lat) ‚Äî precomputed so arcs don‚Äôt compute centroids on the fly.

Flows (per year): flows_2018.csv, ‚Ä¶, flows_2022.csv
Columns: year,origin_geoid,dest_geoid,flow
(Optional extra: group for demographic slice.)

(Later) SHAP/Feature importance: shap\_{year}.csv keyed by GEOID or GEOID_origin,GEOID_dest.

DataProvider (single source of truth)

Why: keep parsing/joins/memoization in one place so Map & Trends stay fast and in sync.

Load files (fetch + PapaParse for CSV).

Build indices:

byYear[year] = flows array

centroidById[GEOID] = {lon,lat}

nameById[GEOID] = NAME

Selectors (memoized):

getFlows(year, stateFilter?, threshold?, metric) ‚Üí array for ArcLayer

getNetSeries(geoid) ‚Üí [{year, net}] for Trends panel

getInOutSeries(geoid) ‚Üí [{year, in, out}] when user toggles

Optional: do heavy aggregations in a Web Worker (nice win if flows get big).

Minimal state to keep in a small Zustand/Redux store: year, viewMode ('county'|'state'), metric ('net'|'in'|'out'), stateFilter, selectedGEOID, threshold.

MapView (deck.gl)

Layers:

GeoJsonLayer (counties)

data: counties.geojson

getFillColor: neutral gray (or themed)

onHover: show county name + net for current year

Pickable: yes

ArcLayer (flows)

data: selector.getFlows(...)

getSourcePosition: from centroidById[origin_geoid]

getTargetPosition: from centroidById[dest_geoid]

getWidth: scale by flow (e.g., sqrt)

getSourceColor/getTargetColor:

Net view: color by sign from selected target county

In/Out view: consistent palette (e.g., in=blue, out=orange)

Performance knobs: draw top N flows or flow >= threshold

Default view

National extent

Year = most recent observed (or 2021)

Metric = Net migration

Threshold = reasonable (e.g., top 10 flows per selected county or flow ‚â• 300)

TrendsPanel (D3)

Input: getNetSeries(selectedGEOID) (default: national aggregate if nothing selected).

Line chart

X = year, Y = net (or in/out if toggled)

2 series if you later add predictions: Observed vs Predicted

Tooltip: year, in, out, net

Responds to: year hover (optional crosshair) & filter changes

FilterPanel

Year slider: 2018‚Äì2022 (or 2013‚Äì2025 when real)

Metric toggle: Net (default) / In / Out

State dropdown: (optional) filters flows & map to that state‚Äôs counties

Search / Select county: sets selectedGEOID

Flow threshold slider: hides tiny arcs for clarity

Data flow (what happens when user interacts)

User moves Year slider ‚Üí store updates {year}

DataProvider recomputes memoized flows for that year & filter

MapView gets new flows for ArcLayer and re-renders

If a county is clicked, store sets {selectedGEOID}

DataProvider computes net series for that county

TrendsPanel re-renders with that time series

Performance tips (with ~3k counties, 5 years)

Pre-simplify geometry (mapshaper: -simplify 10% keep-shapes); keep WGS84 (EPSG:4326).

Precompute centroids server-side and ship county_centroids.csv.

Chunk flows by year (separate CSVs) so you only load what you need.

Threshold small flows by default; expose a slider to reveal more.

Use memoized selectors (Reselect or Zustand selectors) to avoid redoing aggregations.

For very large flows, consider deck.gl binary data (typed arrays) or push heavy groupbys into a Web Worker.

‚ÄúStart small‚Äù build plan (incremental)

Milestone 1 ‚Äî Skeleton & data loading

Render layout, load counties.geojson, draw GeoJsonLayer only.

Hardcode one year; no arcs yet.

Milestone 2 ‚Äî Centroids & flows

Load county_centroids.csv + one flows_YYYY.csv

Draw ArcLayer for that year (top N flows nationally)

Add tooltip for arcs

Milestone 3 ‚Äî Filters

Add Year slider ‚Üí swap flow file (or filter in memory)

Add threshold slider ‚Üí update ArcLayer data

Add county click ‚Üí selectedGEOID in store

Milestone 4 ‚Äî TrendsPanel (D3)

Compute in/out/net per year for selected county

Line chart with hover

Milestone 5 ‚Äî State filter + polish

Dropdown to filter counties to a state (improves clarity & perf)

Legends, color ramps, null states, no-data UX

Milestone 6 ‚Äî Predictions & explainability (stretch)

Add predicted series to TrendsPanel

Inject SHAP top features for selected county/year (bar chart)

An interactive web-based dashboard for visualizing American Community Survey (ACS) data at the PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area) level.  
Built with **React, Deck.gl, Mapbox, D3.js, and Vite**, this project allows users to explore geographic education data and related metrics.

---

## Features

Live Demo: **[View the deployed site](https://whzemuch.github.io/acs-dashboard/)**

- Interactive **map of PUMA regions** using Deck.gl + Mapbox
- **Hover tooltips & popups** with education stats visualized by D3.js
- **Responsive layout** using React components
